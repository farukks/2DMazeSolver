# CSE	4082	– Project	2
This Python program implements a maze solver that supports various search strategies. The supported strategies are:

Depth First Search

Breadth First Search

Iterative Deepening

Uniform Cost Search

Greedy Best First Search

A* Heuristic Search

The program takes a maze file as input. The maze file format is as follows:

The letter “S” denotes the starting square.

The letter “G” denotes one or more goal squares.

The letter “T” denotes the squares with traps.

The cost of each move is one point.

When the agent moves into a trap square, the cost of the move increases by 6 (total cost of the move becomes 7).
